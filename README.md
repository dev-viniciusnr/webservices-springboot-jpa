# Web Services with Spring Boot and JPA

This project was developed as part of my journey to learn backend development with Java. It demonstrates how to build RESTful web services using **Spring Boot**, along with **JPA** for object-relational mapping and database persistence. The goal was to understand how to structure a backend application, expose endpoints, and interact with a relational database using Java's enterprise ecosystem.
